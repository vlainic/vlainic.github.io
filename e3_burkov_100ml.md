## [E.3] Infographic Diagram of *A. Burkov "The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book"*

While reading Andriy's [*The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book*](http://themlbook.com/) for the first time I took several notes. But when I reached the end I realized that there are planty of useful basic advices and guides, that are easily forgotten if one does not use them in regular basis. Notice, even though they are basic we do forgot things...

Henceforth, I decided to read the book once again in more detailed manner and make bullet-like notes for the diagram I plan to make. I want to have this diagram printed out for myself in "my future ML-office", one day... But I also decided to share this diagram with the world as some people might find it useful :)

Here is the preview JPG:
